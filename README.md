# pyalexutil
Various utilities for python. 

This will include a whole bunch of functions that already exist elsewhere, but I like to roll my own version of code because it makes me feel special.

* **2017-08-17** This repo is just at its inception, so it won't contain much just yet. I'll be porting a bunch of stuff from my MATLAB utils package over the next few months.
